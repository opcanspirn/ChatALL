One of the most exciting features of iClone 5.5 Pro is the new MotionPlus format, which allows users to easily save all of their facial, body, accessory, spring and constraint data into a single file that can be reused and reapplied to other characters. This means users can transfer animation data from one unique character to another in a few simple steps, or create a group of characters who perform the same animations with different expressions and accessories.
 
The MotionPlus format also supports sound effects and visible state, which can be used to add realism and variety to the animations. For example, users can add footsteps sounds for a walking character, or show or hide different accessories at different times in the same position. The MotionPlus format is compatible with both standard and non-standard iClone characters, including animals, monsters, robots, and more.
 
Another enhancement in iClone 5.5 Pro is the improved facial creation for custom talking characters. Users can import any image and complete the face fitting process in iClone 5.5 Pro, and turn a 2D image into a talking head with realistic head shape, texture wrapping, side-face image fitting, lip-syncs, and tongue movements.
 
iClone 5.5 Pro also offers other features that make it a comprehensive real-time animation solution, such as light & shadow effects, camera systems, props & scene elements, realtime visuals, physics simulation, multi-camera directing, and visual effects. Users can also access an extensive library of content from Reallusion's online marketplace or import free assets from Google's 3D Warehouse.
